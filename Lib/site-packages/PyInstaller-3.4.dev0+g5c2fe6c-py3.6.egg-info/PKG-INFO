Description: PyInstaller Overview
        ====================
        
        PyInstaller bundles a Python application and all its dependencies into a single
        package. The user can run the packaged app without installing a Python
        interpreter or any modules.

        PyInstaller reads a Python script written by you. It analyzes your code
        to discover every other module and library your script needs in order to
        execute. Then it collects copies of all those files -- including the active
        Python interpreter! -- and puts them with your script in a single folder, or
        optionally in a single executable file.
        
        
        PyInstaller is tested against Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. However, it is not
        a cross-compiler: to make a Windows app you run PyInstaller in Windows; to make
        a Linux app you run it in Linux, etc. PyInstaller has been used successfully
        with AIX, Solaris, and FreeBSD, but is not tested against them.
        
        
        Main Advantages
        ---------------
        
        - Works out-of-the-box with any Python version 2.7 / 3.4-3.6.
        - Fully multi-platform, and uses the OS support to load the dynamic libraries,
          thus ensuring full compatibility.
        - Correctly bundles the major Python packages such as numpy, PyQt4, PyQt5,
          PySide, Django, wxPython, matplotlib and others out-of-the-box.
        - Compatible with many 3rd-party packages out-of-the-box. (All the required
          tricks to make external packages work are already integrated.)
        - Libraries like PyQt5, PyQt4, PySide, wxPython, matplotlib or Django are fully
          supported, without having to handle plugins or external data files manually.
        - Working code signing on OS X.
        - Bundles MS Visual C++ DLLs on Windows.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        PyInstaller is available on PyPI. You can install it through `pip`::
        
              pip install pyinstaller
        
        
        Requirements and Tested Platforms
        ------------------------------------
        
        - Python: 
        
         - 2.7 or 3.4-3.6
         - PyCrypto_ 2.4+ (only if using bytecode encryption)
        
        - Windows (32bit/64bit):
        
         - Windows XP or newer.
            
        - Linux (32bit/64bit)
        
         - ldd: Console application to print the shared libraries required
           by each program or shared library. This typically can be found in
           the distribution-package `glibc` or `libc-bin`.
         - objdump: Console application to display information from 
           object files. This typically can be found in the
           distribution-package `binutils`.
         - objcopy: Console application to copy and translate object files.
           This typically can be found in the distribution-package `binutils`,
           too.
        
        - Mac OS X (64bit):
        
         - Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) or newer.
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Basic usage is very simple, just run it against your main script::
        
              pyinstaller /path/to/yourscript.py
        
        For more details, see the `manual`_.
        
        
        Untested Platforms
        ---------------------
        
        The following platforms have been contributed and any feedback or
        enhancements on these are welcome.
        
        - FreeBSD
        
         - ldd
        
        - Solaris
        
         - ldd
         - objdump
        
        - AIX
        
         - AIX 6.1 or newer. PyInstaller will not work with statically
           linked Python libraries.
         - ldd
        
        - PowerPC Linux (Debian)
        
        
        Before using any contributed platform, you need to build the PyInstaller
        bootloader, as we do not ship binary packages. Download PyInstaller
        source, and build the bootloader::
             
                cd bootloader
                python ./waf distclean all
        
        Then install PyInstaller::
        
                python setup.py install
                
        or simply use it directly from the source (pyinstaller.py).

        .. _v3.3.1 known issues:
        
        Known Issues
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * All scripts frozen into the package, as well as all run-time hooks, share
          the same global variables. This issue exists since v3.2 but was discovered
          only lately, see :issue:`3037`. This may lead to leaking global variables
          from run-time hooks into the script and from one script to subsequent ones.
          It should have effects in rare cases only, though.
        
        * Further see the :ref:`Known Issues for release 3.3 <v3.3 known issues>`.
        
        
        3.3 (2017-09-21)
        ----------------
        
        * **Add Support for Python 3.6!** Many thanks to xiovat! (#2331, #2341)
        
        * New command line options for adding data files (``--datas``, #1990) and
          binaries (``--binaries``, #703)
        
        * Add command line option '--runtime-tmpdir'.
        
        * Bootloaders for Windows are now build using MSVC and statically linked with
          the run-time-library (CRT). This solved a lot of issues related to .dlls
          being incompatible with the ones required by ``python.dll``.
        
        * Bootloaders for GNU/Linux are now officially no LSB binaries. This was
          already the case since release 3.1, but documented the other way round. Also
          the build defaults to non-LSB binaries now. (#2369)
        
        * We improved and stabilized both building the bootloaders and the continuous
          integration tests. See below for details. Many thanks to all who worked on
          this.
        
        * To ease solving issues with packages included wrongly, the html-file with a
          cross-reference is now always generated. It's visual appearance has been
          modernized (#2765).
        
        Incompatible changes
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Command-line option obsoleted several version ago are not longer handled
          gracefully but raise an error (#2413)
        
        * Installation: PyInstaller removed some internal copies of 3rd-party
          packages. These are now taken from their official releases at PyPI (#2589).
          This results in PyInstaller to no longer can be used from just an unpacked
          archive, but needs to be installed like any Python package. This should
          effect only a few people, e.g. the developers.
        
        * Following :pep:`527`, we only release one source archive now and decided to
          use `.tar.gz` (#2754).

        Bootloader build
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The bootloader build was largely overhauled. In the wscript, the build no
        longer depends on the Python interpreter's bit-size, but on the compiler. We
        have a machine for building bootloaders for Windows and cross-building for
        OS X. Thus all mainteriner are now able to build the bootloaders for all
        supported platforms.
        
        * Add "official" build-script.
        
        * (GNU/Linux) Make --no-lsb the default, add option --lsb.
          
        * Largely overhauled Vagrantfile:
        
            - Make Darwin bootloaders build in OS X box (unused)
            - Make Windows bootloaders build using MSVC
            - Allow specifying cross-target on linux64.
            - Enable cross-building for OS X.
            - Enable cross-building for Windows (unused)
            - Add box for building osxcross.
        
        * Largely overhauled wscript:
        
            - Remove options --target-cpu.
            - Use compiler's target arch, not Python's.
            - Major overhaul of the script
            - Build zlib if required, not if "on windows".
            - Remove obsolete warnings.
            - Update Solaris, AIX and HPUX support.
            - Add flags for 'strip' tool in AIX platform.
            - Don't set POSIX / SUS version defines.
        
        * (GNU/Linux) for 64-bit arm/aarch ignore the :program:`gcc` flag ``-m64``
          (#2801).
          
        Module loader
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Implement PEP-451 ModuleSpec type import system (#2377)
        * Fix: Import not thread-save? (#2010, #2371)

        Known Issues
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Data-files from wheels, unzipped eggs or not ad egg at all are not included
          automatically. This can be worked around using a hook-file, but may not
          suffice when using ``--onefile`` and something like `python-daemon`.
        
        * The multipackage (MERGE) feature (#1527) is currently broken.
        
        * (OSX) Support for OpenDocument events (#1309) is broken.
        
        * (Windows) With Python 2.7 the frozen application may not run if the
          user-name (more specifically ``%TEMPDIR%``) includes some Unicode
          characters. This does not happen with all Unicode characters, but only some
          and seems to be a windows bug. As a work-around please upgrade to Python 3
          (#2754, #2767).
        
        * (Windows) For Python >= 3.5 targeting *Windows < 10*, the developer needs to
          take special care to include the Visual C++ run-time .dlls. Please see the
          section :ref:`Platform-specific Notes <Platform-specific Notes - Windows>`
          in the manual. (#1566)
        
        * For Python 3.3, imports are not thread-safe (#2371#). Since Python 3.3 is
          end of live at 2017-09-29, we are not going to fix this.
